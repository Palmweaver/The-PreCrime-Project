# The-PreCrime-Project
Using FACS and Machine Learning to scan for malevolent facial expressions in crowds to predict violence.

With the current need of additional security measures to face an ongoing increase in gun violence within modern society, very few effective tools for prevention are available. There are vast arrays of camera survielance networks to watch crowded areas and many security personel are already trained to look for Facial Action Units (a system created by Dr. Paul Eckman) that indicate iminent violence. 

The PreCrime Project is designed to use Machine Learning to recognize these specific expressions when displayed in public, even if they are not intended to be shown, in large crowds with more accuracy and speed than standard human real-time analysis can deliver.
